# ARTPAY
## An escrow payment system enabling Artists to receive payment for their artworks

# INTRODUCTION
## ARTPAY is a project that intends to solve three crtical problems:
* 1. Artists not getting paid for their art works
* 2. Artists not getting paid on time.
* 3 A trusted system of payment between the Artists and art buyer.
* 4. Ensuring Buyers recieve their artworks. 
 71% of UK Artists who took part in Exhibitions havent been paid in the last 3 years. This has lead to many artists earning below the minimum wage or changing professions.
